# Example Calculator App

This is a simple calculator app that demonstrates how to use generate a typescript SDK from a rust backend, using autogenerated openapi specs to do so.

The process is documented on [this medium post](https://medium.com/@etiennedx00/creating-a-full-stack-app-with-rust-and-react-61783d6afd80).

## Technologies

- Rust
  - poem
  - poem-openapi
- Typescript
  - openapi-typescript-codegen
  - react
